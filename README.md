# Creating my first Strapi.io site

### Installing

They have a pretty simple guide to install Strapi right here: [https://strapi.io/getting-started](https://strapi.io/getting-started). I suggest following that for installing, it's very easy and I already had everything I needed, just Node JS and MongoDB.

You just install strapi globally `npm install strapi@alpha -g` then use `strapi new <name>` to create your project. I named mine myFirstStrapi because it is in fact my first Strapi. I chose MongoDB for the database and used the default values, just spam enter like you do for `npm init` when you forget the `-y`.

**Pro Tip:** By default MongoDB doesn't use a username and password. The user/pass when using `strapi new projectName` is the access to MongoDB not for the project. Don't set these fields if you haven't set one for mongo as it will cause an authentication error.

### Starting Up

When you first launch the app you create the initial login, then it takes you to the interface. **It was love at first site (sight).** What a beautiful interface, I have spent so much time in Wordpress and it's ugly UI that this just put a smile on my face. I love this UI.

The first page you see has a link to a getting started guide on their documentation. Pretty standard. Left side bar is how you navigate to each section just like wordpress.

A very very very nice UI.
